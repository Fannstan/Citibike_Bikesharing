# Citibike Bikesharing

## Overview
The purpose of this project is conduct a statistical analysis to be included in a business proposal for a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, based off of the bike-sharing data gathered from the program run by Citibike in NYC.  The analysis was conducted on Citibike's August 2019 bike-sharing data and began with using Python's Pandas library to convert the tripduration column into a date-time format.  The data file was then uploaded into Tableau where 7 visualizations were created to tell a story of the analysis of the NYC Citibike program.  The images folder in this repository contains the screen shots of each of the data visualizations and here follows the Link to Tableau Story - NYC CitiBike Challenge: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/fredrica.stanley/viz/NYCCitiBikeChallenge_16592802481960/CitiBikeBikesharingDataNYC08-2019 

## Results
The original data file from Citibike displayed the tripduration column as an integer datatype, this column was converted to a datetime datatype to get the time in hours and minutes rather than in total number of seconds. The original file, python code used, and updated file are shown below:
